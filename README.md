Word Guessing Game Project

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Project game built by Javascript

This game project will help students or anyone new/familiar with JavaScript. 

It's a word guessing game where the app randomly picks a word and the player tries to guess the word. The player has 9 chances before the game restarts again by increasing the number of loss by one. The words you guessed will be displayed at the bottom of the page until the number of chances becomes zero. And whenever, the player guesses the right word the number of wins goes up by one. 

It is useful to understand or use as a reference for the concept of 
            - DOM manipulation 
            - Events
            - Scope 
            - varaibles
            - Objects
            - Arrays
            - concatination

I recommend you to look at the HTML before jumping into either jQuery or CSS.

I have tried to give a comment on all the jquery functions and variables which I hope will help you understand the code easily.
